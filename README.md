# Solving Kasiopea with Prolog

This repo will host my solutions to problems that appeared this year in [Kasiopea](https://kasiopea.matfyz.cz/archiv/2021/doma/). The twist? They will be written in [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org).

You can follow this repository if you want to be notified when I add solutions to new problems.

I think it will become a theme that the solutions themselves will be much shorter than the code for parsing and printing, but maybe I'm wrong. In any case, I hope to freshen up my Prolog skills and maybe inspire someone to pick up Prolog.
